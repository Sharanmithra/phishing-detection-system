# 🛡️ PhishGuard AI — Phishing Website Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview

**PhishGuard AI** is an AI-powered phishing detection system that analyzes URLs and predicts whether a website is **phishing** or **legitimate**.

This system uses a **pretrained Machine Learning model** and extracts **87 security-related features** from URLs to detect suspicious behavior.

The project integrates:

* Machine Learning Model
* Flask Backend API
* Interactive Web Frontend
* Real-time URL Analysis

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Detect phishing websites using Machine Learning
* Extract meaningful security features from URLs
* Provide real-time phishing detection
* Display prediction results with confidence scores
* Build a complete end-to-end AI web application

---

## 🧠 How the System Works

1. User enters a website URL
2. Frontend sends request to Flask backend
3. Backend extracts **87 features** from URL
4. Features are passed to the trained ML model
5. Model predicts:

* **Phishing (1)**
* **Legitimate (0)**

6. Result is displayed with:

* Risk Score
* Confidence Level
* Key Detection Signals
